### 2. Testable
#### Type-Driven Design & Test-Driven Development

- Type system
- XCTest & SwiftTest:
    - Unit tests
    - Integration tests
    - UI tests

Other tests to consider:
- Snapshot tests 🟡
- Layout tests 🟡

---

### 3. Scalable
#### Modularization
Static libraries when possible & Mergable dynamic libraries

- Swift Package Manager
    - UI (Design System)
    - Data Source
    - Network
    - Core

#### What we want to achieve?
- Resolve conflicts between teams work
- Even if we decide to go with SwiftUI, UIKit or TCA, MVC or any other solution - it should be easily extended or substituded.
- Optimize time to deliver by caching compiled and tested modules

---

### 4. Automatable

- Design System 🟡
    - Pull resources from Figma (colors, icons, images, fonts)
- Localization 🟡
    - Add translations

#### CI/CD Pipelines:
- 👾 Pull Request [~3m]
    - Build ✅
    - Test: Pull Request Test Plan ✅
    - Static Analyzer 🟡
        - SonarQube
        - Checkmarks
        - Linting
    - Memory analyzer 🟡
- ☀️ Daily
    - Archive ✅
- 🤖 Performance [~10min]

## Our strategy
### What is true about our development process?
- 🟢 We want to deliver frequently, stable, high-quality, measurable, testable, scalable and automatable features.
- 🟢 We want to grow as a team reviewing the development process based on the metrics.
- 🟢 We want to optimize development time and automate tasks when possible
- 🟢 We want to avoid dialects.
- ❓ If there will be millions of users - what is our strategy? 
    - 🟢 Define bottlenecks and continuosly measure, test and improve solutions.
- ❓ If there will be million of tests - what strategy should we use to work with testing? 
    - 🟢 Perfect result: Run only those tests that weren't tested before. Other tests should be splitted and run on schedule.
- ❓ What is the ratio of test time and test coverage we want to achieve?
    - 🟢 Perfect result: Close to the 0. (Example: 1s/99%)
- ❓ What is our definition of delivering the product?
    - 🟢 Product delivered when user downloaded the app, can access to the essential features.
- ❓ What is our strategy of the delivering the product?
    - 🟢 Product should be ready to be shipped any time.
- ❓ What is the lifecycle of our feature?
    - 🟢 Feature should be refined in different stages: before development, during development and after development. For each of the stage should be metrics to measure. (ex.: Feedback Loop)
